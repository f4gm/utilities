Here are some scripts I made to make repetitive work easier:
- crete_folders.py: creates a directory for each file in the specified path.
- list_dir.py: creates a list with the names of each of the files in the directory.
- name_extension.py: extracts the name of a file and its extension from a specified path.
I hope these scripts are useful for you.
